## 📘 About

This project prints **Pascal’s Triangle** up to `n` rows using the mathematical formula:

\[
C(n, r) = \frac{n!}{r!(n - r)!}
\]

The same logic is implemented in **15 languages** to help learners understand syntax and structural differences across languages.

## 💡 How It Works

Every implementation:
- Takes user input for number of rows `n`
- Calculates values using factorial-based combination logic
- Prints Pascal's Triangle in centered or formatted style

## 🧪 Sample Output (for n = 5)

            1
          1   1
        1   2   1
      1   3   3   1
    1   4   6   4   1
